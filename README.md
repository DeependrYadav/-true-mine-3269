### General guidelines
- The system on cp.masaischool.com may take between 1-20 minutes for responding,
- so we request you to read the problem carefully and debug it before itself
- we also request you not just submit it last minute
- try to keep one submission at a time
- Use `${baseServerURL}/what-ever-route` for server url & not `localhost:9090/what-ever-route` in your solution. Failing to do so may cause all the tests to fail.
- If you try to use VSCodes live server, it wonâ€™t work. Use the npm commands provided in this file only.
